Description
-----------
CineR8 *(Pronounced Cine [like in Cinema]-Rate)* is an easy-to-use and very cleanly designed movie rating web application. The design tries to follow Google's Material Design guidelines as best as possible, which makes it look as clean as it does. There are no advertisements or obnoxious elements that hamper the user experience for what should be a simple web application. Check it out now at [CineR8.com](https://ciner8.com)!

Technical Details
-----------
The Web app is built using [Ember.js](https://www.emberjs.com/), a very robust Javascript framework. All of the movie information is pulled from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) via their API. Movie ratings from 3rd party services are pulled from the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). User authentication and ratings are stored using Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) real-time database. The only personal information stored is the user's email, of which is not visible to others and is not shared by CineR8 anywhere.

Why This Project Was Created
-----------
I know that there are bigger and arguably better services that do the same thing as CineR8. My motivation behind creating this web application was mainly to learn Ember.js, but I also wanted something simpler than the well-known services. I think that I acheived both goals and look forward to what this project will become over time.
